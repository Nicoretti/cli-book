Ruby

If you want to learn or read about more details on how to create great command line tools using ruby,
I highly recommend you read this `Book <https://pragprog.com/book/dccar/build-awesome-command-line-applications-in-ruby>`_,
it covers the topic exhaustively.

Rust
++++
The rust community has crated a working group ([CLI-WG][CLI-WG]) which is focusing an creating information and tooling
for people which are interested in creating cli tools using rust. I'll recommend you take a look at their [book][Command Line Application's in Rust].
